# APWorkDayScheduler

This is a simple day scheduler application where users can track tasks for the day.

## Features

Users will find the following features with this application:

* When the user opens the app they see the day scheduler with the current date and time at the top and task blocks for each hour from 9am to 5 pm.
* Depending on when a user opens the app they will see that the block for the current hour has a background of red, all past blocks have a background of gray and all future blocks have a background of green. 
* When a user enters a task and clicks the save button to the right of the hour block there task is saved to that hour block and displays after refreshing the page.

## Credits

For this application I utilized the skills learned in Module 5, including using jQuery and the Day.js APIs. There was a small issue with setting the text color backgrounds which was resolved easily after consulting AskBCS.
